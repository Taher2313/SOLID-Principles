# 4. The Interface Segregation Principle

Segregation means keeping things separated, and the Interface Segregation Principle is about separating the interfaces.

The principle states that many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface. Clients should not be forced to implement a function they do no need.

## Example that shows ISP violation

```java
public interface ParkingLot {

	void parkCar();	// Decrease empty spot count by 1
	void unparkCar(); // Increase empty spots by 1
	void getCapacity();	// Returns car capacity
	double calculateFee(Car car); // Returns the price based on number of hours
	void doPayment(Car car);
}

class Car {

}

public class FreeParking implements ParkingLot {

	@Override
	public void parkCar() {
		
	}

	@Override
	public void unparkCar() {

	}

	@Override
	public void getCapacity() {

	}

	@Override
	public double calculateFee(Car car) {
		return 0;
	}

	@Override
	public void doPayment(Car car) {
		throw new Exception("Parking lot is free");
	}
}
```

Our parking lot interface was composed of 2 things: Parking related logic (park car, unpark car, get capacity) and payment related logic.

But it is too specific. Because of that, our FreeParking class was forced to implement payment-related methods that are irrelevant. Let's separate or segregate the interfaces.

## Solve the violation

We've now separated the parking lot. With this new model, we can even go further and split the **PaidParkingLot** to support different types of payment.
