# 1. The **S**ingle Responsibility Principle

The Single Responsibility Principle states that **a class should do one thing and therefore it should have only a single reason to change**.

This principle can be applied also to the function level not only on the class level.

## Example that shows SRP violation

```java
class Book {
	String name;
	String authorName;
	int year;
	int price;
	String isbn;

	public Book(String name, String authorName, int year, int price, String isbn) {
		this.name = name;
		this.authorName = authorName;
		this.year = year;
        this.price = price;
		this.isbn = isbn;
	}
}
public class Invoice {

	private Book book;
	private int quantity;
	private double discountRate;
	private double taxRate;
	private double total;

	public Invoice(Book book, int quantity, double discountRate, double taxRate) {
		this.book = book;
		this.quantity = quantity;
		this.discountRate = discountRate;
		this.taxRate = taxRate;
		this.total = this.calculateTotal();
	}

	public double calculateTotal() {
	        double price = ((book.price - book.price * discountRate) * this.quantity);

		double priceWithTaxes = price * (1 + taxRate);

		return priceWithTaxes;
	}

	public void printInvoice() {
            System.out.println(quantity + "x " + book.name + " " +          book.price + "$");
            System.out.println("Discount Rate: " + discountRate);
            System.out.println("Tax Rate: " + taxRate);
            System.out.println("Total: " + total);
	}

        public void saveToFile(String filename) {
	// Creates a file with given name and writes the invoice
	}

}
```

In this example class Invoice must be responsible only for calculating the total only. The other two methods are not the responsibility of this class.

## Solve the violation

To solve this violation, we must separate these two methods into to separate classes as follow.

```java
public class InvoicePrinter {
    private Invoice invoice;

    public InvoicePrinter(Invoice invoice) {
        this.invoice = invoice;
    }

    public void print() {
        System.out.println(invoice.quantity + "x " + invoice.book.name + " " + invoice.book.price + " $");
        System.out.println("Discount Rate: " + invoice.discountRate);
        System.out.println("Tax Rate: " + invoice.taxRate);
        System.out.println("Total: " + invoice.total + " $");
    }
}

public class InvoicePersistence {
    Invoice invoice;

    public InvoicePersistence(Invoice invoice) {
        this.invoice = invoice;
    }

    public void saveToFile(String filename) {
        // Creates a file with given name and writes the invoice
    }
}
```

### What will happen if we ignored this principle ?

We will repeat the printing and save to file for every class in the system and if any change is required in any of these two methods we have to solve the problem for all classes (very hard to apply updates).

To save any data to files or print something we need to have an object from class Invoice as this class have these methods. 

So applying this principle helps in solving alot of problems.
